Usually I wouldn't add any text content to this file, it would exist solely as a
marker, something for git to track (see the .gitignore file for related changes)
but I do have a couple points to make here:

  1) People often call this file `.gitkeep`, don't do this. People do it because
  of the naming of the `.gitignore` file, however `git` as a system is aware of
  that file, you could call it an "official" git file... `.gitkeep` however, is
  not a part of the larger git system - call this picky if you will but good git
  practice is valuable and often overlooked

  2) The compilation of this program **now** requires spitting out some object
  files (we'll cover this when we look at compilation, see Makefile for
  practical differences). I don't want to upload arch-specific object files to
  git but I want users to just type `make` without getting "no such dir: obj".
  This gives us two options, put `mkdir -p obj` in the Makefile... which is fine
  for Unix-ish systems... but not for DOS... or include the directory only in
  the repo - I'd choose the latter
