# Bitwise Operators

A program using the XOR operator that creates an encrypted version of a given file using a key. If the output file is passed in with the same key, the output will be the original text.

## Usage

`./main [key] [input file] [output file]`

I've included a text file containing lorem ipsum for easy testing.
